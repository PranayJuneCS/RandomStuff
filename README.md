Random Projects for Fun

Projects Include:

1. Stable Marriage Algorithm Solver
	- Enter any number of men and women and their preferences. Using
	- the stable marriage algorithm, my program will return the (male)
	- optimal pairing that the algorithm produces.

2. Polynomial Interpolator
	- Given a number of points over a finite field (working over a prime
	- modulus), this program will give you the unique polynomial that 
	- is guaranteed to pass through those points.
